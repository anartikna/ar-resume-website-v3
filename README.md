# ar-resume-website-v3
First iteration of a new style (Left sidebar menu driven) for my personal website https://ranaankit.com/ built using GatsbyJS. Gatsby can be used to build static sites that are Progressive Web Apps, follow the latest web standards, and are optimized to be highly performant. It makes use of the latest and popular technologies including ReactJS, HTML and CSS.
